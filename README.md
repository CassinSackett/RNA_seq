# RNA_seq
This repository contains scripts and pipeline for analyzing sequence capture data.

The pipeline is outlined step by step in the Word doc.

Some of the steps are described in more detail in the Smithsonian tutorial here: https://github.com/SmithsonianWorkshops/2020-01-28-NMNH-RNAseq/ although I have made some adaptations for our cluster.
